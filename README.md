- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ells543211
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computer science and mainly the stem feild, piano, and tennis.
- ğŸŒ± I have been interested in computer science since joining a coding club in the middle school. Since then I have taken Computer science principles + AP in school, and Python, Quantum, and Swift outside of school. I continue to pursue my interests through the many projects I am working on in and out of school.
- ğŸ“« I hope to become profficient in Swift in the future!
