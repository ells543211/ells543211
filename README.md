- 👋 Hi, I’m @ells543211
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science and mainly the stem feild, piano, and tennis.
- 🌱 I have been interested in computer science since joining the club in the middle school. Since then I have taken Computer science principles in school, and Python outside of school. I continue to pursue my interests through the many projects I am working on in and out of school.
- 💞️ I am taking this class to learn more about the many languages and hopefully become profficient so I can create more projects
- 📫 I hope to put my best effort in all my projects and make them original and creative
- 📫 I don't have to many worries as I know I must stay focused and pursue my knowldge outside of school.
